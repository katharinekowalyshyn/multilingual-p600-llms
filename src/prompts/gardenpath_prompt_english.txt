Generate a garden-path sentence in English.

A garden-path sentence is one where the initial interpretation leads the reader down the wrong path,
requiring reanalysis when disambiguating information arrives.

The sentence should:
1. Be natural and grammatically correct in English
2. Create initial misinterpretation that requires reanalysis
3. Have a clear disambiguation point
4. Be appropriate for linguistic research
5. Be written entirely in English

Generate only the sentence, no explanations or additional text.
