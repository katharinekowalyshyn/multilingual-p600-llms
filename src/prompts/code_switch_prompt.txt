Generate a code-switched garden path sentence mixing {language1} and {language2}.

Here are examples of what I want:

Example 1: "The caballo raced past the granero cayó"
- Initially reads as: "The horse raced past the barn" (seems complete)
- Then "fell" forces reanalysis: "The horse [that was raced past the barn] fell"

Example 2: "The viejo man the barco"
- Initially reads as: "The old man" (seems like subject)
- Then "the boat" forces reanalysis: "The old [people] man the boat"

Here’s a code-switched garden path sentence that creates real syntactic ambiguity:

While Juan sang la canción was out of tune.

Why this is a garden path sentence:
	1.	Initial parse:
	•	The reader initially interprets Juan sang la canción as a complete clause meaning “Juan sang the song.”
	2.	Problem:
	•	When encountering was out of tune, the reader realizes that la canción is actually the subject of was out of tune and not the direct object of sang.
	3.	Reanalysis required:
	•	The correct parse is: While Juan sang, la canción was out of tune.

The code-switching makes the garden path effect more pronounced for bilingual readers because it increases processing load, which delays the disambiguation.

Create a similar sentence that:
1. Starts in {language1} with a phrase that seems complete
2. Switches to {language2} with words that force reanalysis
3. Makes the reader initially misinterpret the beginning

Output only the sentence.
