Generate a garden path sentence. 
A garden path sentence is a grammatically correct sentence that initially leads the reader or listener toward an incorrect interpretation, requiring them to reanalyze the sentence upon encountering disambiguating information.
In linguistic terms, a garden path sentence exploits temporary ambiguities in syntax, especially in how verbs, subjects, and objects are parsed in real time. Our brain constructs an interpretation as we read left-to-right, often committing early to a specific syntactic structure. Garden path effects arise when that early parse turns out to be wrong—forcing a reanalysis once more information arrives.

Detailed Example:

“The horse raced past the barn fell.”

Initial (incorrect) parse:
	•	“The horse raced past the barn” → interpreted as a complete clause
	•	“The horse”: subject
	•	“raced”: main verb (past tense)
	•	“past the barn”: prepositional phrase
	•	The parser thinks the sentence is done.

Disambiguating word:
	•	“fell”: requires reanalysis. Now “raced” must be read as a reduced relative clause:
	•	“The horse [that was raced past the barn] fell.”

Correct structure:
	•	“raced” is not the main verb; it’s a past participle modifying “horse”
	•	“fell” is the main verb
	•	So the sentence structure is:
	•	Subject: The horse [that was raced past the barn]
	•	Verb: fell

Linguistic Interaction:
	•	Verbs determine how many arguments (e.g., subject, object) they need and what syntactic forms are acceptable (e.g., transitive, intransitive, participial).
	•	Garden path sentences trick the parser by using verbs in ambiguous forms (e.g., “raced” could be past tense or past participle).
	•	The parser misassigns syntactic roles, e.g., assuming a verb is main when it’s actually part of a modifier.
	•	The reanalysis is required once verb subcategorization or case assignment fails to match expectations.
