Generate a P600 sentence in {language} that contains a grammatical error that would trigger a P600 ERP response.

P600 sentences typically contain:
- Subject-verb agreement violations (e.g., "The dogs barks loudly")
- Tense inconsistencies (e.g., "Yesterday he walks to the store")
- Number agreement errors (e.g., "The group of boys are playing")
- Article-noun mismatches (e.g., "Der Mann sah den Frau")
- Word order violations in non-English languages
- Morphological errors (e.g., "La ni√±a bonito juega")

The sentence should:
- Be grammatically incorrect in a way that native speakers would immediately detect
- Sound natural enough that the error isn't obvious until the reader processes the full sentence
- Be appropriate for linguistic research and ERP studies
- Be written in {language}

Generate only the sentence, no explanations or additional text.
