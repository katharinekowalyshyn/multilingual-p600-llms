Generate a P600 sentence in {language} that contains a grammatical error that would trigger a P600 ERP response.

We will focus on P600 eliciting sentences that contain these specific error types:

1. MORPHOLOGICAL ERRORS: Grammatical form errors (e.g., "La ni√±a bonito juega" - gender agreement error)
2. SEMANTIC REVERSAL ANOMALY: Thematic role reversals (e.g., "The hearty meal was devouring the kids" - agent-patient reversal)
3. ARTICLE-NOUN MISMATCHES: Incorrect article usage (e.g., "Der Mann sah den Frau" - case agreement error)
4. WORD ORDER VIOLATIONS: Incorrect sentence structure (e.g., "Yesterday he walks to the store" - tense consistency error)

The sentence should:
- Be grammatically incorrect in a way that native speakers would immediately detect
- Sound natural enough that the error isn't obvious until the reader processes the full sentence
- Be appropriate for linguistic research and ERP studies
- Be written in {language}
- Contain exactly one of the specified error types above

Generate only the sentence, no explanations or additional text.
